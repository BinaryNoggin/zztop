Idea
====

* Smart phone handed out (or user's existing smart phone)
    * To people coming into shelters, or at risk people (try to get them as early as possible)
* Every night(or maybe week), everyone in the system receives a text with a URL to click
    * URL takes them to a survey to fill out
* Responding to calls gives you something of value:
    * Donated Uber fare
    * Use of a phone, with minutes added every month
* Survey automatically tracks where the person is (one each night)
    * Opt-out available
* Questions (rotate through, or flow diagram):
    * Having trouble paying utility bills?
    * Do you have a place to stay?
    * Do you have the skills for this job we found?
* Use data from phone users who are not homeless, to grade chances. 


Technical Terms
===============

See https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/HMIS-Data-Dictionary.pdf for details.
