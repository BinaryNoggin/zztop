Idea
====

* Smart phone handed out (or user's existing smart phone)
    * To people coming into shelters, or at risk people
* Every night, everyone in the system receives a text with a URL to click
    * URL takes them to a survey to fill out
* Responding to calls gives you something of value:
    * Donated Uber fare
    * Use of a phone, with minutes added every month
* Survey automatically tracks where the person is (one each night)
    * Opt-out available
* Questions (rotate through, or flow diagram):
    * Having trouble paying utility bills?
    * Do you have a place to stay?
    * Do you have the skills for this job we found?
